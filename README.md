# Liri-Node-App

This app runs commands inputted through the command line and runs inputs put after the commands. For example, if "spotify-this-song" is a command, "happy" would be typed after it to search for a song named "happy." In the same light, "movie-this" is used to search for a movie, "concert-this" is used to search for concerts by a particular artist, and "do-what-it-says" is used to do what command is written in a .txt file.
